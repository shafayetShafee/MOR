Description: Provides a postestimation function to calculate the Median Odds Ratio
    (MOR) from a multilevel binary logistic regression model fit. Currently this package
    provides the Median Odds Ratio only in case of two-level random intercept model
    and three-level random intercept model where the model is fitted using the R
    packages 'lme4', 'GLMMadaptive' or 'glmmTMB'.

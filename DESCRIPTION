Description: This package provides a postestimation function to calculate the median odds
    ratio (MOR) from a multilevel binary logistic regression model fit. Currently this 
    package provides the MOR point estimate and confidence interval only in case of two- 
    and three-level random intercept model where the model is fitted using the R packages 
    'lme4', 'GLMMadaptive' or 'glmmTMB'.

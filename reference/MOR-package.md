# MOR: Calculate Median Odds Ratio From a Fitted Multilevel Binary Logistic Model

Provides a postestimation function to calculate the Median Odds Ratio
(MOR) from a multilevel binary logistic regression model fit. Currently
this package provides the Median Odds Ratio only in case of two-level
random intercept model and three-level random intercept model where the
model is fitted using the R packages 'lme4', 'GLMMadaptive' or
'glmmTMB'.

# MOR: Calculate Median Odds Ratio From a Fitted Multilevel Binary Logistic Model

This package provides a postestimation function to calculate the median
odds ratio (MOR) from a multilevel binary logistic regression model fit.
Currently this package provides the MOR point estimate and confidence
interval only in case of two- and three-level random intercept model
where the model is fitted using the R packages 'lme4', 'GLMMadaptive' or
'glmmTMB'.
